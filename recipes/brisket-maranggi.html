                    <li>1/4 cup vegetable oil</li>
                    <li>1/4 cup tamarind juice</li>

            <div class="steps">
                <ol>
                    <li>Preheat your oven to 300Â°F</li>
                    <li>
                        Toast the coriander and cumin seeds in a dry skillet over medium heat until fragrant, about 1-2 minutes. Let them cool and then grind them into a fine powder using a spice grinder or mortar and pestle.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        In a small bowl, mix together the ground coriander and cumin, turmeric powder, minced garlic, brown sugar, salt, and black pepper to make the maranggi seasoning.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Rub the maranggi seasoning all over the brisket, making sure to cover it evenly. Let the brisket sit at room temperature for about 30 minutes to allow the flavors to penetrate the meat.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        In a Dutch oven or large oven-safe pot, heat the vegetable oil over medium-high heat. Sear the brisket on all sides until browned, about 5 minutes per side.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Mix together the soy sauce, tamarind juice, and water in a bowl. Pour the mixture over the brisket in the pot.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Cover the pot with a lid and transfer it to the preheated oven. Cook the brisket for 4-5 hours, or until the meat is tender and easily plils apart with a fork.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Once the brisket is cooked, remove it from the pot and let it rest for about 10 minutes before slicing it thinly against the grain.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Serve the sliced brisket with a side of rice or mashed potatoes, and perhaps a few slices of fresh cucumber or tomato.
